 * DONE!!! This lab was really straightforward because I thought
 * everything through UNTIL the AI. I hadn't planned for that, and
 * so accessing the methods and such were all a pain. I felt like
 * I had done it neatly until I realized I had to set a button to
 * call the method. I had coded neat little flagging and revealing
 * methods, but they had to switch between highlighting and acting
 * upon the highlights which was super hard to debug. I just had so
 * many different errors throughout this program and I have no clue
 * how I'd do a lot of this without Eclipse. Things like the scrolling
 * would just be so much harder. The customization was a nice feature
 * I built in towards the end as well.
